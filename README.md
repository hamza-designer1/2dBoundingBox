A C++-based post-processing tool that works inside Unreal Engine and can be called in blueprint
Generates high-precision, tightly fitted bounding boxes in Darknet format using engine ground truth masks—ideal for object detection pipelines.
Key Features
Accurate Bounding Box Generation
Converts Unreal Engine pixel-perfect segmentation masks into precise bounding boxes formatted for Darknet (YOLO) object detection.
Unreal Engine Integration
Designed as a post-processing step in Unreal Engine workflows—leveraging real-time rendering capabilities for ground truth mask extraction.
Tooling & Automation
Standalone Python CLI tool to automate bounding box creation; easily integrates into synthetic data generation pipeline
